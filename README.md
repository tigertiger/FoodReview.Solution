Build an API that allows users to GET and POST reviews about various foods. Here are some user stories to get started. Note that you will have to create custom endpoints for some of these user stories.

As a user, I want to GET and POST reviews about foods.
As a user, I want to GET reviews by food group [see food pyramid for help].
As a user, I want to see the most popular foods by number of reviews or by overall rating.
As a user, I want to PUT and DELETE reviews, but only if I wrote them. (Start by requiring a user_name param to match the user_name of the author on the message. You can always try authentication later.)
As a user, I want to look up random foods just for fun.
